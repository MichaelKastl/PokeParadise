# PokeParadise
 Personal game project to hone my skills with C#. Discord.NET-based bot for the chat client Discord.
 
 **Project Details**
 
 For those interested in the Pokemon series, you may be aware that, despite the dozens of main-line games and spinoffs of the Pokemon franchise, there has yet to be a single game 
 where the focus is *not* on battling. This project is made to fill that niche. Pokemon do not fight. Instead, the focus of the game is hatching eggs, competing in Contests, and 
 breeding, caring for, and raising Pokemon. The project has been tested by a group of friends on a private Discord server, and the current Release build has no known bugs. 
 
 Currently Testing: Contest update. Requires a bit more testing to ensure that move effects are working properly.
